# Training and deploying an MNIST digit classification model using TrueFoundry

1. Train the model. You can train the model and track your training using MLFoundry by following along [train.ipynb](./train.ipynb).
2. At the end of training, we save the model and print the run id. Copy the run id - we will be using it to deploy an API service and a Gradio interactive webapp.
