## Description of the Problem

The aim of the problem is to predict the quality of red-wine as a number between 0-10 with input features like pH, density etc of red-wine.

## Dataset Description

Here is the Link to the dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/code/sevilcoskun/red-wine-quality-classification/data

![img.png](../assets/img.png)

Size of dataset: 100.95 kb 
Number of Unique Rows: 1599
Total Columns: 12 (11 input features, one the target quality value)

## Model Trained

The model trained is a RandomForestClassifier. 
The model is trained using sklearn and we have used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
